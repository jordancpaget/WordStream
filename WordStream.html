			<h2>PPC- Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h2>
			<p>PPC (pay-per-click) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requitements for PPC optimization:
			<ul>
				<li> PPC Automation- While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of pay-per-click avertising, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your buisiness.</li>
				<li>PPC Management-PPC management refers to the maintenance and prioritization of paid search marketing tasts. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make of break an online ad campaign</li>
			</ul>
			<p> WordStream's PPC software is specifically designed to aid in these two PPC search engine marketing areas. This page will show you both the processes the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.</p>
